# ğŸš€ A quick and dirty C++ WebAssembly demo ğŸš€

This demo demonstrates that we can import and instantiate `C++` classes in a browser. To run the demo you need to have the Emscripten toolchain installed. To get started see [the official docs](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/index.html).

After you've installed the toolchain, simply run `npm i` and then `npm start`.
